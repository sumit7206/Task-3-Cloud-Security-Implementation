Task 3: Cloud Security Implementation
Abstract
In this task, I implemented essential cloud security measures using Amazon Web Services (AWS). I created a custom IAM policy to grant read-only access to a specific S3 bucket, and attached it to an IAM user with programmatic access only. To ensure data security, I also verified that default server-side encryption (SSE-S3) was enabled on the bucket. This task reinforced my understanding of principle of least privilege, secure access control, and data protection best practices in a cloud environment.
